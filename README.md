# Franklin's Personal Website

Welcome to my Github page! I've used this site over the past three years to gain technical skills, store completed projects, and explore the work that thousands of others add to the site each day.

This repository stores the code for my personal website, franklinmorgan.co. The page provides a quick intro to me circa 2016 and has current links to relevant sites and email addresses.
